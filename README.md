# Performance Analysis and Simulation

BD and BIDE models for PAS exam @ University of Camerino.

## Report
The report about the project can be found [here](Performance_Analysis_and_Simulation.pdf).

## How to run
- Clone the Sibilla repository at https://github.com/quasylab/sibilla
- Navigate to the Sibilla folder and from the terminal run the following command:
```
cd sibilla
./gradlew build
./gradlew installDist
```
- Copy the content of this repository inside the **_shell\build\install\sshell\bin_** folder
- Navigate to the aforementioned folder and from the terminal run the **Sibilla Shell**:
```
sshell
```
- Launch the scenario of interest (e.g. BD vs BIDE)
```
> run "bd_vs_bide/bd.sib"
```

Once the simulation has ended and the results have been collected, the [Jupyter Notebook](analysis.ipynb) contains the code needed to actually analyse the data and extract the various graphs.
